## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to show items based on different user-selected filters, which actually was the main purpose of this challenge. The knowledge from this challenge will definitely be very helpful in future challenges which will require filtering.

Most of other things I already knew before (like mapping), but filtering by using .filter(), .every() and .includes() was a new concept to me.

The project is also fully responsive on all devices and resolutions, made possible by using multiple media queries.
